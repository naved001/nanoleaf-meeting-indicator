A quick script that sets my nanoleaf to red if I am using my webcam, and white
if not.

Things I'd like to do:

* Set nanoleaf to orange if a Mic is in use.
* Set the nanoleaf to its original state instead of setting it white.
* Connect it to my outlook and flash the nanoleaf for 15 seconds before the start of a meeting, should serve as a good reminder.
